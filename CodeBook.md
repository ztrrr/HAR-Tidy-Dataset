HAR Tidy Dataset CodeBook 
================================

Data:
=====
The data for this data set comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset[1]

Variables:
==========
Taken from features_info.txt from the HAR datest:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Subject is the numeric label of the person whose movements were recorded performing the Activity 
Activity is the character string label of the activity the subject performed from which the data was gathered. 

Transformations:
================
The body of data came in two different files, "test" and "train", and were subsequently merged together.

The Subject and Activity data existed in two different files and were then merged into the larger dataset. 

The following variables were estimated from the above signals and were included in this tidy dataset: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The mean of these variables was calculated for each unique combination of subject and activity and the results of that calculation is stored in the final "tidydf" dataframe.
